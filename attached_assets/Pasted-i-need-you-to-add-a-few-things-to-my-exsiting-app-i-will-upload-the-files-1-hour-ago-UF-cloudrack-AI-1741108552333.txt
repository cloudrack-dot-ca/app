I'll start the application in development mode for you. However, I notice that before we can run it, we should make sure all dependencies are installed. Would you like me to proceed with installing dependencies and starting the application?

I'll help install the dependencies and start the application. Once it's running, we can examine the current maintenance mode functionality before adding the coming soon feature. Please give me a moment to set this up for you.
