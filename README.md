### Billing Logic
- **Included Bandwidth**: Every server includes 1TB (1000GB) of outbound transfer per month
- **Server-specific Billing Periods**: Bandwidth is calculated from each server's creation date
- **Prorated Limits**: Bandwidth allocations are prorated for partial first months
- **Overage Rate**: Usage beyond the included amount is billed at 0.5% of monthly server cost per GB
- **Automated Processing**: Overages are automatically calculated and charged at the end of each billing period
- **Transparent Reporting**: All bandwidth charges clearly labeled in transaction history
- **One-click Access**: View detailed bandwidth statistics directly from server control panel

### Technical Implementation
- Bandwidth data collected hourly via server metrics
- Aggregated daily for efficient storage and reporting
- Intelligent calculation based on server-specific periods
- Automatic unit conversion for clear data presentation (MB/GB/TB)
- Enhanced error handling for more reliable monitoring

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Administration
